# Project PROPOSAL for Loris Bertschi's Project

## Project Title & Category

### 1. Project Title

"Portfolio Insight: An Integrated Reporting Tool for Multi-Account Investors"

### 2. Project category

My project is likely to fall in the Data Analysis & Visualization category as it involve generating reports coupled with analysing some data and deriving KPI's from it. 

## Problem Statement & Motivation

Most online trading platforms include a built-in performance tracker or P/L tool that’s precise, well-designed, and updates instantly. However, no single app offers access to every type of asset or security an investor might want. As a result, many investors end up juggling multiple trading apps, managing several accounts, and tracking different portfolios across various platforms. This fragmentation makes it difficult to get a clear, consolidated picture of overall performance.

The goal of this project is to build an application or interface that allows users to centralize all their holdings and investments in one place. By entering their positions and relevant details, users will be able to monitor their total portfolio performance and receive daily or weekly reports offering a clear, visual overview of their returns across all platforms and asset class. 

## Planned approach and technologies

First, I will research the key metrics and reporting features that major trading platforms provide, so I can identify which data points and KPIs are most relevant to include in my project. Then, I’ll connect my app to a reliable financial data source or API to access real-time market prices, ensuring the performance indicators remain accurate and up to date. Finally, I’ll focus on building a visually appealing, intuitive web interface—most likely using Python with good frameworks for interactive data visualization—so users can easily navigate and understand their portfolio insights..  

## Expected challenges and how you’ll address them

I think the biggest challenge will be the data collection as the financial market is very data-heavy and require constant actualisation to keep up with the prices. These data or API can be really hard to find/implement or can be really expensive in some case. I'll adress them by doing report on a daily or weekly basis that way i can minimise the "by the second" effect of the market. 

## Success criteria (how will you know it’s working?)

I'll know my programm is working if the report come up daily/weekly and that they effectively track the market and generates accruate KPIs that reflect real world performance.

## Stretch goals (if time permits)

The next goal of this project would be to have it working on real time basis and having the UI showing the evolution of the investor portfolio move in real time.
